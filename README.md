# Current_and_Voltage_sensor
This is my project that i take time for make. I think it was too easy but real life LOL.






For Detailling :
+ What I want to do?
  - Measurement Voltage 100V
  - Measurement Current 10A
+ What I want to use ?
  - STM32 Chip for control and computing
  - Amplifier Non inverting circuit for gain voltage from Shunt resistor (Low side or under load)
  - Voltage divider for reduce voltage and use STM32 read ADC
  - OLED for monitoring Voltage and Current
